          Swift is an expense tracker application that allows you to see how you
          spend your money. When adding an expense you have a few categories to
          choose from: 'Personal', 'Groceries', 'Going Out' and 'Bills'.

        <p className="homepage-container__paragraph">
          Choose 'Personal' for any expenses related to travelling, buying books
          and generic online shopping. Choose groceries when spending at a
          supermarket, select going out when paying for meals and drinks at
          restaurants/pubs and bills for any expenses related to subscriptions,
          payments for rent etc.
